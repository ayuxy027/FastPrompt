Recommendation: Use a Code Project block (Next.js App Router) rather than MDX. This scope involves multiple pages, reusable components, and route handlers (auth, data fetching), which fit best as a full React/Next app. We can scaffold pages for dashboard/reports/settings, add shared layout (header/sidebar), implement charts with Recharts, and wire up route handlers for login/signup. If youâ€™d like, I can start by creating the project structure and core components in a single Code Project.
