# FastPrompt Project Study and Future Features Plan

## Current Implemented Features

### Core Functionality
1. **Prompt Expansion Engine**: A JSON-first UI/UX prompt expansion system that transforms basic UI ideas into detailed, implementation-ready specifications
2. **Hero Section with Prompt Input**: Includes a text area where users can input their UI ideas (e.g., "Create a SaaS dashboard for analytics")
3. **Sample Prompts**: Pre-filled examples to guide users (e.g., "Create a modern SaaS dashboard", "Design an e-commerce product catalog")

### UI/UX Components
4. **Navigation System**: Complete navbar with Home, Site Builder, JSON Editor, API, and Pricing links
5. **Authentication System**: Login page with email/password and Google authentication
6. **Physics-based Cursor**: Smooth animated cursor with Framer Motion
7. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
8. **Infinite Marquee**: Dual-direction scrolling testimonials in Reviews section
9. **FAQ Accordion**: Interactive accordion component using ZennitUI
10. **Custom Design Elements**: Block components for visual design elements and decorative design elements

### Tech Stack
- React 19, TypeScript
- Vite build tool
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- React Router for navigation

## Detailed System Capabilities (Based on systemPrompt.ts)

### Output Structure
The system generates comprehensive JSON specifications including:
- Layout specifications: Screens, structure, responsive design, navigation
- UI Details: Typography, colors, spacing, icons, buttons, inputs, modals, cards, tables
- Visual design: Hierarchy, shadows, border radius, theme style, lighting
- Micro-interactions: Hover, click, and other small UI behaviors
- Interactions: Flows, animations, validations
- Functionality: API endpoints, data logic, auth flow, dynamic behavior
- Tone and audience: Branding hints, content style

### Integration Focus
- Designed to work with tools like v0.dev, Bolt.new, and Lovable
- Outputs structured JSON that can be used by AI design tools for better results
- Focuses on creating "implementation-ready specifications" that bridge the gap between ideas and actual UI implementation

## Planned/Expected Features (Based on Navigation and System Design)

### Site Builder
1. **Visual Site Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating UI designs
2. **Component Library**: Pre-built components that users can drag into their designs
3. **Real-time Preview**: Live preview of the created site

### JSON Editor
4. **JSON Visualization**: Visual representation of the JSON output
5. **JSON Editing Interface**: Advanced editor for fine-tuning JSON specifications
6. **JSON Validation**: Validation against the defined schema

### API Section
7. **API Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for the FastPrompt API
8. **API Keys Management**: Interface for users to manage their API keys
9. **Usage Analytics**: Dashboard showing API usage statistics

### Pricing Page
10. **Tiered Pricing**: Different pricing tiers based on API usage or features
11. **Feature Comparison**: Comparison table of features available in each tier
12. **Subscription Management**: Interface for managing subscriptions

### Advanced Features (Inferred from System Prompt)
13. **Template Library**: Pre-built templates for common UI patterns
14. **Export Options**: Export functionality for different design tools
15. **Team Collaboration**: Features for multiple users to work on projects together
16. **Version Control**: History of changes and ability to revert to previous versions
17. **Integration Marketplace**: Integration with more design and development tools
18. **Custom Branding**: Ability to apply brand colors, fonts, and styles consistently
19. **Accessibility Compliance**: Automated checks and suggestions for accessibility
20. **Performance Optimization**: Recommendations for optimizing UI performance

## Technical Improvements Needed
21. **Actual Prompt Processing**: Implement the functionality to process user inputs and generate JSON output
22. **Backend Integration**: Connect frontend to AI model that generates the JSON specifications
23. **User Dashboard**: Account management and history of created prompts
24. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for API and user inputs
25. **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators for prompt processing
26. **Form Validation**: Validation for user inputs in various forms

## Summary
The FastPrompt project is currently implemented as a frontend showcase with placeholder UI elements but lacks the actual core functionality of processing prompts and generating JSON specifications. The system prompt defines a comprehensive specification for what the AI should output, but the frontend components that would utilize this functionality need to be fully implemented.
